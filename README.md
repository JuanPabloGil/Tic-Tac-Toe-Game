## Tic-Tac-Toe
Creation of Tic Tac Toe Game
This is our first object oriented programing project where we use our knowledge of building different classes and methods where we only share the necessary information. The tic tac toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
